JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is used for transmitting data between a server and a web application. It is a text-based, language-independent format that can be easily understood and parsed by humans and machines alike. JSON files are often used to store and transfer data between different applications and systems.

A JSON file consists of a collection of key-value pairs, where the keys are strings and the values can be strings, numbers, boolean values, arrays, or other JSON objects. JSON files are usually stored with a .json file extension and can be opened and edited with any text editor.

One of the main advantages of JSON is its simplicity and ease of use. The format is designed to be easy to read and write, making it an ideal choice for developers and non-technical users alike. It is also a very lightweight format, which means that it can be transmitted over the internet quickly and easily.

JSON is widely used in web applications and APIs because of its interoperability with a variety of programming languages and technologies. It is also supported by most modern web browsers, making it an ideal format for building dynamic web applications and integrating with web services.

In conclusion, JSON is a lightweight and easy-to-use data interchange format that has become ubiquitous in modern web development. It provides a simple and flexible way to store and transmit data, making it an essential tool for developers working with web applications and APIs.
